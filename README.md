- Stream other player positions?

- The "Breadcrumb" Ghost: When you fail, your previous "ghost" stays on the last correct tile you stood on, helping you orient yourself for the next run.
- Echo Location: The player can "ping" once every 5 moves to reveal a future correct tile for a split second.

- Cracking Tiles: Some correct tiles might only be safe for 3 seconds before they "break," forcing the player to move quickly through known sections.
- Patrolling Sentinels: An enemy moves in a set pattern across the grid. You have to navigate the invisible path while timing your jumps to avoid the guard (the player cannot move backwards, so they must plan their route carefully).
- Rotating Grid: Every 10 seconds, the entire 7x7 grid rotates 90 degrees. The path stays in the same physical space, but your orientation changes, which is a massive challenge for spatial memory.
