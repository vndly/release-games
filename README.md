- Stream other player positions?
- Side bullets?
- The "Breadcrumb" Ghost: When you fail, your previous "ghost" stays on the last correct tile you stood on, helping you orient yourself for the next run.
- Echo Location: The player can "ping" once every 5 moves to reveal a future correct tile for a split second.
- Cracking Tiles: Some correct tiles might only be safe for 2 seconds before they "break," forcing the player to move quickly through known sections.
- Patrolling Sentinels: An enemy moves in a set pattern across the grid. You have to navigate the invisible path while timing your jumps to avoid the guard.
