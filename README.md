- Stream other player positions?

Feedback: Heavy emphasis on Sound Design—using haptic vibrations or melodic cues to signal when a player is "getting warmer" to the correct path.

- The "Breadcrumb" Ghost: When you fail, your previous "ghost" stays on the last correct tile you stood on, helping you orient yourself for the next run.
- Echo Location: The player can "ping" once every 5 moves to reveal a future correct tile for a split second.
- The Scan Pulse: You can press the spacebar to reveal the next 3 tiles in the path, but doing so drains 20% of your "Light." If you run out of Light, you have to navigate the rest of the level in total darkness. Also, it blocks you from moving for 5 seconds.
- The Mapping Tool: Every time the player dies, the tile they died on is temporarily marked with a "X". This "X" disappears after a few seconds.

- Press space bar to send an echo pulse that reveals 8 adjacent tiles but it makes the game darker. The player can choose to restart the game and the score.

- Patrolling Sentinels: An enemy moves in a set pattern across the grid. You have to navigate the invisible path while timing your jumps to avoid the guard.
- Add power downs in the path. The player can choose to collect them or wait until they disappear.
  - Invert controls
  - Rotates the grid
